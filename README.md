# GamerGator
GG app provides UF and nearby Gainesville gaming community a central web-app that informs them of all local gaming events for a wide variety of fandoms and platforms. This new web-app would support everything from organizing and posting an event or tournament, provide all the necessary information participants need to know, and allow for all potential participants to pre-register or RSV. Ultimately, the goal is to keep the gaming community informed, united, and strong.

To run: `node server.js`
