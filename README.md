# GamerGator
GG app provides the UF and nearby Gainesville gaming community a central web application that informs them of all local gaming events for a wide variety of fandoms and platforms. This new web-app would support everything from organizing and posting an event or tournament, provide all the necessary information participants need to know, allow for all potential participants to pre-register or RSVP, and so much more. Ultimately, the goal is to keep the gaming community informed, united and strong.

To run: `node server.js`
